I assume that developer before this query used DML 'Delete'.
Ok, and how delete can influence time of operation?
The root of the problem lies in the HWM ORACLE, 
when new records are added, the HWM will slowly move up, 
but after deleting the records, the HWM will not move down.
Count 0 rows as it did to count for example 10000000.
This is because Oracle is busy reading all of the blocks 
below the HWM to see if they contain data.
If you want to delete everything in table,then use Truncate.
Truncate reset HWM to 0.
Before writing this i experimented. I create table and
insert 4 millions rows from another table.Then I Write query
'Select Count(*) FROM new_table' and remembered execution time.
After I deleted from 'new_table' all rows and repeated my query.
At the end I compared execution time before and after.
They were identical.
